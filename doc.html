                <h2>About</h2>
                <p><a href="https://github.com/Lif28/KatLogger">KatLogger</a> is a keylogger made in python by <a href="https://github.com/rickyfili10">rickyfili10</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Lif28">Lif28</a>
                    It stores all the hit keys in the log.txt file that it's created when KatLogger runs.<br>
                    The first release "KatLogger_1.0.zip" works only on "windows computers" :(, 
                    but we're working to make other release that work on both linux and windows,
                    and obviusly adding more feature (sendind the log.txt file by email, opening backdoors that connects the victim computers to yours and much more).
                </p>
                <h2 class="line">Functioning</h2>
                <p>KatLogger is made in python and it basically stores all the hit keys in the file named "log.txt".<br>
                   The code is obliusly open source :), and the main file is "KatLogger_main.py" in the "python" folder, there are also other files but not all of those are really used by KatLogger.
                   These are simply new feature that we'll add in the future... (version 1.1)<br> The first time that KatLogger runs, it creates a file that executes KatLogger on the StartUp, Infact if the computer is shutdown and than turned on, KatLogger will run as normal.
                   Windows Defender doesn't detect KatLogger as a virus, but it's been months since we developed that and we'll implement better bypass function of windows defender in the version 1.1 .
                </p>
